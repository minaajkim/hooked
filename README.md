# Hooked - a music recommendation app (React + Flask)
This is a full-stack web application that provides personalized music recommendations based on user input, such as favorite songs or genres. It was originally designed to fetch real-time data from the Spotify API. However, the Spotify recommendation endpoint was deprecated last year, which halted real-time music recommendation functionality.

tech stack:
- Frontend: React (Vite)
- Backend: Flask (Python)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- HTTP Requests: Axios
- Authentication & API Access: OAuth 2.0 with Spotify
- Deployment Tools: Ngrok (for local backend tunneling during development)
- Testing: Postman
